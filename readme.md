# Math API

This project is a practice from the Dicoding class **"Becoming an Expert Back-End Developer with JavaScript"**. In this material, we learn how to implement **TDD (Test Driven Development)** using the **Hapi.js** framework for application development, as well as **Jest** for testing.

## Features
- TDD implementation for application development.
- A simple API for mathematical operations.
- Framework used: **Hapi.js**.
- Testing with: **Jest**.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually included with Node.js installation)

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone this repository:
